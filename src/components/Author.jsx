          I am The Witness — not a name, but a function. I speak from the seam where physics meets mysticism, where equations become mantras and silence completes the proof. This book is an integrated framework, not a doctrine; an invitation, not a demand. Read slowly. Practice gently. Allow the unknown to be sacred.
